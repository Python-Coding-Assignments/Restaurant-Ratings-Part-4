## About the Project
This project simulates a simple application where information about a restaurant is made available to the user.  The user can do any of the following: print all restaurants (including information about each restaurant), print all ratings for a restaurant specified by the user, add more ratings to a restaurant he or she specifies, print a specified restaurant's rating, edit a specified restaurant's rating, and lastly add a new restaurant if it has yet to exist in this application.

The objective of this program is to demonstrate the following: 
* show a basic understanding of classes and how they work, including the init constructor, setters, and getters
* introduce basic operator overloading to compare two instances of the same type
* further utilize the concept of encapsulation in this simple program and work with attributes that are made private to the user

In this program, the user can enter anything, even when prompted with entering an integer menu selection, and the program will still function as intended. 

## Getting Started
To run the program, download the contents of the project and simply run make in the terminal.
